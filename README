THE NICSim-vhd SIMULATION MODEL RELEASE 0.1
============================================


This is the README file from the source distribution of NICSim-vhd. 
More recent information may be available on the Web at an anonymous 
Git repository where you can access our latest source code

	http://github.com/ggaray/nicsim-vhd/

	NICSim-vhd is a VHDL-based network interface model for modelling and 
simulation of NIC's buffers. See the file COPYING for the copyright notice 
and copying conditions. Our Elservier Journal of Systems Architecture paper, 
available from the journal's web site, will give you a feeling for what 
NICSim-vhd can do.

***** To Build 

REQUIRED: To quickly verify that everything works, first install GHDL, an open-source 
simulator for the VHDL language. To get the binary distribution or more information, 
go to http://ghdl.free.fr

To create the NICSim-vhd executable, at the command line type:

ghdl -a *.vhd
ghdl -e test_nicctrl

***** To Run 

At the command line type:

ghdl -r test_nicctrl --stop-time=6730ns 2>/dev/null

This will execute the VHDL simulation model using a sample configuration for 6730 ns.
As a result, NICSim-vhd generates a set of output files (*.out). 

NOTE: Keep in mind that according to the simulation setup, the size of the output 
files can be *huge*.

***** Configuration

A section devoted to configuration purposes is included in the files buffmngr.vhd, 
nicctrl.vhd, dmactrl.vhd, clkgen.vhd, traffgen.vhd, statsgen.vhd, arbiter.vhd. 

***** To do

To use a single configuration file.
