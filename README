THE NICSim-vhd SIMULATION MODEL RELEASE 0.1
============================================


This is the README file from the source distribution of NICSim-vhd. 
More recent information may be available on the Web at an anonymous 
Git repository where you can access our latest source code

	http://github.com/ggaray/nicsim-vhd/

	NICSim-vhd is a VHDL-based network interface model. See the file COPYING 
for the copyright notice and copying conditions. Our Elservier Journal of Systems 
Architecture paper, available from the journal's web site, will give you a 
feeling for what NICSim-vhd can do.

Please, see 
	
***** To Build 

REQUIRED: To quickly verify that everything works, first install GHDL.
To get the binary distribution or more information, go to http://ghdl.free.fr

To create the NICSim-vhd executable, at the command line type:

ghdl -a *.vhd
ghdl -e test_nicctrl

***** To Run 

At the command line type:

ghdl -r test_nicctrl --stop-time=6730ns 2>/dev/null

This will execute the VHDL simulation model using a sample configuration for 6730 ns.
As a result, NICSim-vhd generates a set of output files (*.out). 

NOTE: Keep in mind that according to the simulation setup, the size of the output 
files can be *huge*.

***** Configuration

The required configuration files for the various DRAM types reside in the
mem_system_def directory. For dram types where both power and performance
simulation is supported, there are two configuration files - an spd file for
the timing parameters and a dsh file for the power parameters.
